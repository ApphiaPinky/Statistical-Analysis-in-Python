## Introduction to Statistical Analysis with Python

This contains an introduction to statistical analysis, a fundamental aspect of data science and machine learning. By understanding and applying statistical methods, we can derive meaningful insights from datasets, make predictions, and inform decision-making.

### Sections Overview

1. **Basic Concepts in Statistics**:
   - **Population vs. Sample**: Learn the difference between the entire population and a subset (sample) used for analysis.
   - **Importance of Sampling**: Understand why sampling is critical for cost and time efficiency.

2. **Understanding Basic Statistical Methods**:
   - **Descriptive Statistics**: Measures like mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation are covered, which summarize data effectively.
   - **Inferential Statistics**: Techniques like hypothesis testing, confidence intervals, and regression analysis are introduced to make predictions from sample data.

3. **Getting Started with Python**:
   - Installing necessary libraries (e.g., pandas, numpy, scipy, scikit-learn) and getting set up for statistical analysis.

4. **Applying Statistical Methods to Datasets**:
   - Practical examples of descriptive and inferential statistics using Python.
   - Application of these methods to datasets such as the Diabetes dataset from scikit-learn and datasets from sources like Kaggle.
